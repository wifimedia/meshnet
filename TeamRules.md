Team rules:

1. Notify the team as soon as you know you are going to be late.

2. Primary means communication is listserv. Urgent communication needs to be phone. Try to call during reasonable hours, but we are “on call” 24/7 for this project. If no response is received within 12 hours, call to follow up.

3. Ask for a response in emails if one is desired.

4. Weekly meeting will include workload balance discussion.

5. A task is behind when it is one day late.

6. Tasks are due at 11.59pm on the day they are due, unless otherwise specified.

7. We will have brief weekly progress reports from each member at our weekly meetings. We will also have bi-weekly code reviews.

We need to eventually come up with style guidelines for code, especially comments.
