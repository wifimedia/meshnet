I. Requirements
==============
- A copy of OrangeMesh (available at http://meshnet.googlecode.com)
- Apache, MySQL, PHP. You can get all these with XAMPP, at http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html.
- Be sure you've compiled PHP with sendmail support (if you're using XAMPP, it's already there)
- A stout heart: this is development code.

II. Setup your database
=======================
The easiest way to set up your database is to use phpMyAdmin. Under "Privleges" create a new user called 'orangemesh' with any password you like (remember this!), and click the option to "Create a database with same name and all privileges".

The database structure is stored in orangemesh.sql. Import this file into your database. It will create the "orangemesh" database with two tables "network" and "node". The "network" table contains information about all the network accounts
stored on this dashboard server. The "node" table contains information about every node for every network on the server.

Next, open the file /lib/connectDB.php in a text editor. Under "Database Configuration Options" change the value of "dbPass" to whatever the password you created in your dashboard. Save your changes.

III. Install the dashboard files
================================
Copy the dashboard server files into your webroot directory (under XAMPP, this is htdocs). Everything should be working now. In a browser, go to http://localhost (or whatever directory you've placed the dashboard files), and you should see the main page for the dashboard.

IV. Configuring your Web Server
===============================
Finally, before you get off and running, you should take some steps to secure your web server. If you're using XAMPP, the simplest thing to do is run the security script. You can do this from the console or through the web at http://localhost/security/xamppsecurity.php.

You should also probably lock your system down a bit further, depending on your setup (i.e., disable directory listings in Apache). A detailed explaination of how to secure your web server is outside the scope of this document, but there are many good resources available online. One geared towards XAMPP is http://robsnotebook.com/xampp-security-hardening.
