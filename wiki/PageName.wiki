Team rules:

1. Notify the team as soon as you know you are going to be late.

2. Primary means communication is listserv. Urgent communication needs to be phone. Try to call during reasonable hours, but we are “on call” 24/7 for this project.

3. Ask for a response in emails if one is desired.

4. Weekly meeting will include workload balance discussion.

5. We will re-evaluate these rules at our meeting in two weeks.
