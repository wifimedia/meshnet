 <h1>Welcome to OrangeMesh!</h1><br>
<div style="margin:0px auto;width:60%;text-align:left">
Feel free to poke around and see the features we're working on. However, you should know this is a development server. We try to keep the software on this up-to-date with our latest development builds. Sometimes that means we have to clear out the database, so don't expect any changes you make here to be permanent.<br><br>
You can take a look at our really early online documentation <a href="http://student-affairs00182.dhcp.unc.edu/sgWiki/index.php/OrangeMesh">here</a> (and check out the UNC Student Government Wiki while you're at it).<br><br>
Thanks for supporting OrangeMesh! See our <a href="http://meshnet.googlecode.com">project page</a> for more information.<br><br>
Problem? Check the help documentation on our project page, then <a href="mailto:shasan@email.unc.edu">contact the developers.</a>
